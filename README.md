# Open Source Development Onboarding Project <!-- omit in toc -->

Welcome to the Open Source Development team! This is our onboarding project, which is designed to demonstrate how you can learn more about and contribute to a typical open source project.

~~F in chat for the old onboarding project~~

This Project is an advanced mathematical calculator that performs a thorough analysis of a select number *n*. From determining evenness to finding the *n*th taxicab number, this program will uncover all you ever wanted to know and more.

## Getting started

### Install Git

You need to have Git installed and set up on your computer.

#### Windows

We recommend [setting up WSL](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_wsl.html) now, as it's very likely that you'll need a Linux environment at some point.

#### macOS

The "Xcode Command Line Tools" comes with Git. To install it:

- Open `Terminal`
- Type in `git version`
- If you see something like this, you're good to go:
  ```shell
  $ git version
  git version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)
  ```
- If not, you should be prompted to install the "Xcode Command Line Tools"
- After the install finishes, run `git version` again.

#### Linux

Use your system's package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`, etc) to install Git. The package is usually named `git`.

### Set up GitHub CLI (`gh`) ** This is optional and not necessary **

The GitHub CLI makes it easy to interact with GitHub using the `git` command line interface. It logs you in to GitHub.com via your web browser, which means you don't need to manually set up SSH keys or generate Personal Access Tokens (PAT)!

#### Install on Windows or Linux

Refer to GitHub's documentation on installing `gh`: <https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md>

On Windows, you should use WSL and follow the instruction in your WSL terminal. 

If you're on Ubuntu (including WSL), you may run:

```sh
type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

The commands above do the following:

- Install `curl` (a command-line HTTP client) if needed
- Configure the `apt` repo, and download its signing key, for `gh`
- Install `gh`


#### Install on MacOS

On MacOS, you should install `gh` using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install gh
```

If you don't have Homebrew installed ("command not found" when you run `brew`), you should install Homebrew. Refer to <https://brew.sh> for instructions.

### Log in to GitHub

Once you have `gh` installed, run:

```sh
$ gh auth login
```

You should see a prompt like this, and you should select options as shown here:

```console
$ gh auth login
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? You're already logged into github.com. Do you want to re-authenticate? Yes
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser

! First copy your one-time code: XXXX-XXXX
Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
✓ Authentication complete.
- gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
✓ Configured git protocol
✓ Logged in as XXXX
```

When it asks you to

> `Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...`

Press Enter, and your browser should open. Paste the 8-character code shown in the prompt, sign in to your GitHub account, and click "Authorize."

## Working on the onboarding project

There are many things you can do with the onboarding project. At minimum, you should:

- Locate and take a look at existing Issues and Pull Requests (PR).
- Fork the repo, and clone your fork to your computer.
- Look at the source code, compile, and run it. Use the provided Makefile.
- Make a minor change to any existing file, then commit and push your changes using the `git` command line.
  - A "minor change" could be anything! For example, you may add a few words to the README, or add a `print()` statement to `welcome.py`.
  - Do not edit files with the GitHub web interface!
- Submit a PR with your changes.
  - Provide a descriptive title and description.
  - A good title/description should clearly state what you changed.

You may also:

- Fix an existing issue, improve existing code, or add a new feature. Then, submit a PR with your changes.
- Find an issue in the existing codebase, and report it by creating a new Issue.
- Take a look at other people's PRs, and review their code.
  - If you'd like to do this, ask a lead to add you as a reviewer to a PR.
  - You can approve, request changes, or add comments to the PR.
  - You may also provide specific feedback for specific line(s). To do this, drag and select the line number(s).
- Rebase existing PRs against the `main` branch, and resolve any merge conflicts.
  - Try to do this with the `git` command line. Do not use the GitHub web interface.

## Tips

### Makefile

The provided `Makefile` specifies these commands:

- `make` or `make release`: compile `./welcome`, with `-O2` and no debug symbols.
- `make debug`: compile `./welcome_debug`, with debug symbols.
- `make clean`: clean up all compiled binaries.

### Some useful Git commands

The following Git commands may be useful:

- `git clone`
- `git commit`
- `git pull`
- `git push`
- `git fetch`
- `git rebase`
